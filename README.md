## ZERO PANIC
The only thing which worsens the casualties in times of a natural disaster is panic among people to find a safe shelter. Our Webapp aims to tackle this problem. The purpose it serves can be divided into 3 steps :
- Firstly, it can be used to find safe paths to safe locations in such disaster-affected areas where the state rescue and relief teams may take some time to reach. 
- Secondly, once a user reaches a location he/she can mark the destination as safe/unsafe which will help to find new safe locations and strike out the old ones which are no longer usable, in real time.
- Thirdly, once a user reaches a safe location, he/she can find family members if present in the same safe location.
